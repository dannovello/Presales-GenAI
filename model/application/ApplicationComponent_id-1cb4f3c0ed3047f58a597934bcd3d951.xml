    documentation="Cleaning and encoding&#xD;&#xA;  -&#x9;find the incorrect, incomplete, inaccurate, or irrelevant/missing data in context and then modifying, replacing, or deleting it. &#xD;&#xA;  -&#x9;Encoding is the process of categorizing ordinal and nominal data to facilitate machine learning in model development. ML requires that all input and output variables to be numeric. It is a required pre-processing step when working with categorical data for machine learning.&#xD;&#xA;- Disparate data types are hard to merge  &#xD;&#xA;     - Vibrations can be recorded as lengths of time or as frequencies; &#xD;&#xA;     - temperatures can be in celsius or fahrenheit; &#xD;&#xA;     - videos or images might not be to the same scale. &#xD;&#xA;     - Timings can get out of step, especially when data are sampled at different rates. eg. aircraft communication systems send signals every few nanoseconds, but navigation systems record the position of a plane every second.&#xD;&#xA;        Averaging fine data doesnâ€™t help because detail is lost.&#xD;&#xA;"/>
